## Hi there 👋 Aspiring Software Tester 🛠️ | Passionate about Quality & Automation

Hi! I'm a third-year Computer Science student diving deep into software testing. Over the past three months, I’ve been honing my skills in both manual and automated web application testing, working with tools like Cypress, Postman, and JMeter.

I enjoy ensuring software works as expected and beyond, finding edge cases, and automating tests to make life easier.

### Here, you'll find my testing projects, from manual test cases to automation scripts. Let's connect and build better software together! 🚀
